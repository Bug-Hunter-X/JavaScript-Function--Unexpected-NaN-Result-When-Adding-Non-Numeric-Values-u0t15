This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript functions involving unexpected results when performing arithmetic operations with non-numeric values. The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers, but it doesn't include proper type checking, leading to `NaN` (Not a Number) results when strings or other non-numeric data types are passed as arguments. The solution demonstrates how to improve the function with explicit type checking to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure that only numeric inputs are handled correctly. The provided examples clearly illustrate the problem and the effective solution.
